# Solar System

## Description: 
I'm currently learning & working with threejs. I was thinking about a side project I can work on in order to deep into this magnifique library; I saw this example on their page among amazing other ones, I picked this one (love at first sight) and I wanted to rebuild my own copy. 


## Features :

- [ ] Add all planetes with their rotations and so on.
- [ ] Change textures to 2k to load faster
- [ ] Update the camera!
- [ ] Add a stars texture to the scene
- [ ] Update the planete rotation work arround!
- [ ] Add stats!
